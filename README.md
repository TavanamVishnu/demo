# demo
practicing git
----------------
i am simply editing readme file to check status command
status of files in Git
-----------------------<br>
Untracked-U -> git is not tracking this file<br>
modified-M -> git is tracking but there are some modifications done to this file<br>
staged -> whenever we add files that are modified but not commited they are in staged state ready to commit<br>
unmodified -> unchanged after commited<br>

Commands
---------<br>
git add -> adds new or modified files in our working directory to git staging area(ready to commit)(engagement)<br>
git add . -> to take all modifications in working area to staging area<br>
git commit -> (married) but simply commiting doesnt make changes to github<br>
git push -> update repo in github(update local changes to github repo)<br>
