status of files in Git

staged -> whenever we add files that are modified but not commited they are in staged state ready to commit
unmodified -> unchanged after commited

git add -> adds new or modified files in our working directory to git staging area(ready to commit)(engagement)
git add . -> to take all modifications in working area to staging area
git commit -> (married)
